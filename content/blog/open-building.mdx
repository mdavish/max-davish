In my experience building B2B software, I've repeatedly observed that a
philosophy of **open building** tends to create the highest quality, most useful
software. An "open building" approach involves building _all_ software as if it
were top quality, customer-facing software.

Traditionally, when companies build software, they build it very differently
depending on whom it's for, and there are basically three constituents you might
be building for:

1. **Customers:** People who are paying money for your software and keeping your
   business alive. Customers are the most important constituent and generally we
   direct most of our effort toward building for them. However, in B2B SaaS, the
   customers who actually use the software are sometimes a captive audience.
   Sometimes they have no choice but to use your software because their company
   may be locked into a long contract with you. As a result, quality and
   usability sometimes suffer. But in general, customer-facing software is held
   to the highest standard.
2. **Prospects:** People who are considering buying your software. For
   prospects, the goal is usually to get them into some kind of demand-gen flow
   and get them talking to a salesperson as soon as possible. As a result,
   software built for prospects often optimizes for appearance and engagement by
   (i.e. flashy landing pages).
3. **Employees:** People who work at your company. Employees naturally need
   software do to their jobs. Often these employees are engineers who rely on
   microservices built by other engineers. Though they could also be other types
   of employees - salespeople, marketers, business analysts - who are seeking
   information or tooling to do their job. In this category, usability often
   suffers greatly. If customers aren't going to be using the software, why
   should we invest in making it sleek and intuitive?

Most companies treat these three user personas very differently when building
software. But a **philosophy of open building** demands that they all be treated
essentially the same, because the lines between them are actually surprisingly
blurry, and treating them all as equal and deserving top quality software
actually yields better outcomes for everyone.

To make things more specific, my philosophy of openly building software has four
main tenants:

1. Internal platforms should be built to the standards of consumer products.
2. Whenever possible, internal microservices should be made into public APIs.
3. Everything should be documented publicly.
4. Products should be free to try out.

Let's go through each to understand why it's important.

## Internal Platforms

Every software company has internal platform teams whose primary customers are
other engineers at the company. A few classic examples of such teams are...

- A UI team that manages a UI component library for other teams to use
- An SRE team that manages CI/CD pipelines
- An infrastructure team that manages things like Kubernetes clusters,
  Terraform, etc.
- A data engineering team that manages a data warehouse for other teams to use
- An ML Ops team that manages the trainining and deployment of ML models

These teams play a critical role in the success of the company. While they don't
deliver software _directly_ to customers, they control the speed, consistency,
and reliability with which the rest of the company can deliver software.

In my experience, the software that these teams deliver tends to be held to a
lower standard of usability than software that is delivered directly to
customers. These teams tend to think less about things like developer
experience, API design, and documentation than teams who are delivering software
directly to customers. After all, these teams are building software for their
colleagues, so it's doesn't matter if it's a bit clunky. It's not like a
customer is going to complain about it and cancel their subscription.

I think this is a mistake. I think that internal platforms must be held to the
same standards that external products are. There are two reasons. The first
reason is that almost nothing is more important than making your own employees
efficient. The cost of forcing your employees to use clunky software is every
bit as great as the cost of forcing your customers to use clunky software.

By slowing your employees down and forcing them to use unintuitive APIs or
unreliable services, you are wasting the most valuable resource your company
has: time. One of the most important determinants of success in the software
business is speed - can you ship features faster than your competitors and fast
enough to keep up with your customers' rising expectations?

Every moment your engineers spend dealing with a slow CI/CD pipeline, or writing
their own UI components from scratch, or waiting for a data warehouse query to
run, is a moment they are not spending doing work that actaully adds value. As a
leader, this should terrify you every bit as much as bad customer-facing
software.

The second, less obvious reason for holding internal platforms to a high
standard is that many of them can ultimately become new sources of revenue. The
most classic example of this happening is Amazon Web Services. AWS began as an
_internal_ platform meant to save Amazon's own engineers time on tedious,
"undifferentiated heavvy-lifting" like provisioning databases, servers,
messaging queues and the like. But it wasn't long before Amazon realized that,
if they had these problems, every other company building software probably did
too. Led by now-CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon made AWS into a public product, and the
rest is history. Today, AWS is a $100 billion business.

At Yext, where I currently work, we recently underwent a similar process with
our [Pages product](https://www.yext.com/platform/pages), which is used to build
SEO-optimized websites for thousands of businesses. Pages was once a
walled-garden, internal platform that only Yext employees could use to build
websites. But increasingly we realized that many of our customers wanted to use
this technology to build websites on their own, or with the help of a
third-party agency. So we opened up our platform and made it into a public
product.

In the process, we not only unlocked a new revenue stream but also dramatically
improved the quality of the product, because we were forced to now hold it to
the standards of an external, customer-facing platform. This meant creating a
more intuitive developer experience, better documentation, and a more
interoperable system built on Vite and React. This dramatically improved
developer experience also made our _own_ team dramatically more productive.

## Make Private Microservices Public APIs

A second, closley related principle is that you should strive to make all
internal microservices into public APIs. "Internal microservices" is a broad
term that I'll use to refer to any piece of software that communicates with
other internal software and/or employees but not with the outside world. This
includes RPCs that interface with each other as well as admin portals where
internal employees can perform priveleged actions that ordinary customers can't.

In a B2B setting, you should be wary of these internal microservices. You should
question always ask yourself, "Should we just make this public?". For example,
if you've written a microservice that fetches the data and displays it on a
table in an admin portal, why not just make it a public API that returns JSON?
Then you can use that same API to power your admin portal, but you can also use
it to power a public-facing dashboard that your customers can use to see the
same data.

In my experience, this type of programmability and interoperability is crucial
for large enterprise customers. Big enterprises almost always want to do things
programatically, often with complex business logic. If you require them to
manually click around in your platform or manually import and export data, you
will hamper their ability to do their jobs. A good litmus test here is that you
everything you can do by clicking around in your platform should _also_ be
doable programatically, via API.

Furthermore, making internal microservices into APIs again forces you to hold
your API design to a higher standard. It forces you to think more about the
developer experience for the person using your API. Even if it turns out that
customers don't use an API and only your own employees do, you've still saved
yourself a lot of time and effort by making it easy for your own employees to
use.

## Document Everything Publicly

The third tenant of my open building philosophy is that (virtually) everything
about your software should be publicy documented. Public documentation should
include...

- Public, transparent pricing
- A public changelog for your product
- Thorough documentation and guides for all public APIs and SDKs
- A public roadmap for your product
- Transparency into security practices, SOC2, etc.
- A public, open forum for questions and support
- Transparency into your company's technology stack and engineering practices
- Special documentation outlining the behavior of any machine learning systems,
  with a special focus on governance and ethics

In fact, there are very few things that should _not_ be documented publicly.
Public should be the default position for all documentation, and documentation
should only be private if there's a good reason. "Competitive advantage" is
usually _not_ a good reason to keep things private, especially when it comes to
high-tech ML products in a B2B setting. Allowing your customers to understand
and have confidence in your product is much more important than keeping your
intellectual property a secret.

Furthermore, you should strongly consider maintaining both your public and
private documentation in the same system. If some documentation about internal
microservices or company practices needs to be kept private, consider simply
simply adding an `isPrivate` flag somewhere in your documentation system that
hides it from external users but exposes it to internal employees.

A single source of documentation is dramatically easier to maintain than
separate systems for public and private documentation, and it has the benefit of
making your own employees' lives easier, since they will no longer need to
search between several different systems to find what they're looking for and
can instead use the same, high-quality documentation portal that your customers
use.

The other key benefit of documenting everything publicly is that it forces us to
hold documentation to a higher standard. If customers might read it, we tend to
make the documentation more polished and thorough.

Even more than that, writing public documentation forces us to scrutinize our
ideas and systems more deeply. If something sounds stupid when you write it
down, and if you'd be embarrassed to have a customer read it, then you should
probably think twice about whether it's a good idea in the first place.

## Make Everything Free to Try

Finally, I believe that all software should be free to try out. This means that
anyone should be able to sign up (ideally using Github or Google) and start
trying out your product without speaking to a salesperson. Ideally, your product
should also come with some amount of free usage, so that a new user can
accomplish something meaningful with it before they spend any money. This is a
key tenant of product-led growth - the idea that customers want to actually use
your product before they ink a deal with you.

The most obvious benefit of making your product free to try is that it generates
demand. Allowing prospects to actually use - and hopefully love - your product
is 1,000x better than any landing page or whitepaper at generating
top-of-the-funnel demand for your product. In the past decade, companies like
Slack and Github have had enormous success with this bottoms-up growth model.
Users have adopted free versions of these products, loved them, and eventually
convinced their companies' IT departments to buy them.

But a subtler, equally important benefit of making your product free to try is
that it forces you to think much more about your product's usability,
information architecture, and overall quality. If you know that your customers
are going to thoroughly vet your product before they sign a big deal with you,
then you are forced to hold your product to a much higher standard. The product
needs to be intuitive, fast to get started with, and utterly bug-free. Anything
less and you could lose the deal.

## About

I'm Max. I'm currently a product manager at [Yext](https://www.yext.com/), where
I lead our [Search](https://www.yext.com/platform/search) product. Yext Search
(previously "Yext Answers") is an enterprise search platform that allows any
company to build powerful search engines using the same technology that Google
uses.

I'm passionate about software and I love what I do. I want to devote my life and
career to using software to make the world work better. I think bits, bytes, and
numbers can solve almost any problem.
